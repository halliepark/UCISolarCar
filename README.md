# UCI Solar Car

This is a website for UCI Solar Car

Built with:
* [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
* [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
* [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) (using MongoDB)
* [Animejs](https://animejs.com/)

If continuing development work:

After cloning, run 
```
npm install
npm run css-build
gatsby develop
```

Now the website should be up and running on localhost:8000

*Note:* Strapi and therefor blog posts are not synced yet, more on that later
