We wanted to extend a big thank you to The Green Initiative Fund (TGIF) for funding us! With their help, we now have the entire budget we need to finish up the solar car! Moving forward, in coordination with TGIF, to help spread the word on renewable energy, Solar Car will be hosting numerous workshops throughout winter and spring quarter. We already have some planned for this upcoming Monday (3/2) and Tuesday (3/3): there will be an Additive Manufacturing Workshop led by our chief Mechanical Lead and Suspension Lead.

Following the spring quarter, some of our plans will include a Solar Cell Encapsulation Workshop, sustainable artwork competition, and a possible tour of the National Fuel Cell Research Center (NFCRC). The turnout of these workshops will determine whether or not we can host more in the future, so if you’re interested, we encourage you to come out!

If anyone you know who’s trying to get funding for a sustainable/renewable energy project, we highly recommend applying for TGIF.



Moving onto another sponsor, we recently received helpful items from HyperX Gaming, including SSDs, a keyboard, and a mouse. Our design members have been using these SSDs, which has immensely assisted them by speeding up their design process. Having a keyboard and a mouse in our lab has been very useful for our members traveling with a laptop and has assisted our telemetry team with their work. We would also like to give a big thank you to HyperX; we hope to build an involving relationship with them! See below to check out our Telemetry member, Nathan Trudeau, working with the keyboard mouse and SSD.
